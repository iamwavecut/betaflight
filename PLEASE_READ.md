Hey, @wavecut.

Hope you're doing well! I'm Valeriy and I noticed you're using the GitHub username @wavecut. I've been using this handle on other platforms for many years, and it's kind of become part of my digital identity.
I was hoping you'd consider swapping GitHub usernames for me to own my handle.

Of course, it's entirely up to you. Just thought it was worth asking, and I hope you're fine with it.
Thanks for considering!

Best wishes,
Valeriy
